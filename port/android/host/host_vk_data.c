/*
HOST_VK_DATA.C

The Vulkan renderer's host half, phase 3 (port/android/VULKAN.md): the upload rings
and the frame's data table. What a draw reads was copied by the guest into the command
stream at the draw (vk_data_put in d3d8_vk.c); here the host copies it out of the
stream, during the hand-over, into host-visible memory the GPU reads, and keeps where
each piece (an id) went, so that later commands can name it. The game's own memory is
never read here: only the bytes in the stream.

One ring for each frame in flight: a list of buffers, filled front to back and never
moved once something is placed in them (commands already recorded name them), reset
when the frame's fence has passed. Nothing here waits on the GPU for a resource: the
only wait is for the frame's fence, which the frame's command buffer needs as well.
