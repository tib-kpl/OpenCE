/*
HOST_PROBE.C

Reports where the game's memory window holds values that point back into
it.

The game data is linked to the addresses inside the window (a map file's
tag cache sits at 0x803a6000, and its tag directory holds a name and a
base address per tag), so a build that puts the window somewhere else can
only work if every one of those values is moved with it. This probe finds
them, so that work can be written against what is really there rather
than against a guess.

The window is the guest's memory and this is the same process, so the
probe just reads it: 32-bit words, aligned, whose value is an address
inside the window. A value that lands there by accident (a texel of
0x80808080, say) cannot be told from a pointer by looking at it, so the
report groups the values by the 4 KB page they were found in. A handful
of pages full of pointers is a handful of structures to move; pages that
are mostly texture data are not.

Two things make the reading unsafe, and both are dealt with here rather
than assumed away:

- the guest maps and unmaps as it runs (thread stacks come and go), so a
range that was readable when the probe looked may be gone by the time it
reads. host_probe_skip_fault() catches the fault and the page is
skipped, so the worst case is a page missing from the report;
- the part of the window the guest has not mapped is reserved, and
reading that faults. The probe therefore takes its ranges from
/proc/self/maps and only reads what is mapped and readable.

It starts itself a few seconds after the game does and then looks every
few seconds, and says something whenever the numbers move, which is how
one notices that a map has finished loading. Nothing else in the app
uses it.
