/*
HOST_VK_VISIBILITY.C

The Vulkan renderer's host half, phase 6, step 6 (port/android/VULKAN.md): the game's visibility tests (lens flares), as
occlusion queries. The guest sends VK_COMMAND_VISIBILITY_BEGIN where the game begins a test and VK_COMMAND_VISIBILITY_END (the
game's slot and the pixels each of the game's pixels covers in the target) where it ends it; the draws between are the test's. A query may
not span a rendering's end, so a test takes a group of four query slots (reset together at its beginning, outside rendering) and
each rendering it spans uses one of them (more than four are not counted: said once); the parts are added up.

At the frame's end the results are copied (vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults, outside rendering, waiting on the queries) into a
host-visible buffer of the frame's slot; when that frame's fence has next passed, each test's samples are divided by the
target's scale area (visibility_unscaled in d3d8_gl.c: the game divides by its own test's area, so a count at the screen's scale
would make flares too bright) and kept as the slot's latest count. host_vk_visibility gives the latest count and never waits, as
d3d8_gl.c's query buffer path: the latest from this test, or from an earlier one while the GPU is behind.
