/*
VK_COMMANDS.H

What the Vulkan renderer's guest half (d3d8_vk.c) asks of its host half
(port/android/host/host_vk*.c): a stream of commands, written into guest
memory over a frame and handed to the host in one call (host_vk_submit), so
that a frame costs one crossing from the guest to the host rather than one a
draw. port/android/VULKAN.md ("The command stream") says what each means.

Shared by both halves, which are built for different ABIs (the guest's
pointers are 32 bits, the host's 64): every field is a 32-bit integer or
float, and an address is a guest one, which the host can read directly (the
guest's memory is below 4 GB; it reads what a command names during the
hand-over and never afterwards).

Each command starts with a header naming its type and its size in bytes, the
header included; sizes are multiples of 4.
