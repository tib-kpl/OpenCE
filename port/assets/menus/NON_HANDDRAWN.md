# Menu pictures that are not redraws

The menus' bitmaps are drawn from the high-res redraws (`svg/`, from ui-svg-handmade) where there is
one. The PC version's pictures that have none (3D renders, screenshots and logos) are not in this
repository.

## From the Xbox's map

These have the same pictures, in the same order, in the Xbox's `ui.map`, which the menus draw them
from (the player's own; nothing is shipped). `mp_map_grafix`: the Xbox's has the 13 Xbox maps' pictures
(the PC version's first 13) and its "?"; the PC version's other 8 are its own maps'.

- `ui\shell\bitmaps\colors_sm`
- `ui\shell\bitmaps\mp_map_grafix`
- `ui\shell\bitmaps\sp_levels`
- `ui\shell\main_menu\difficulty_select\difficulty_options`
- `ui\shell\main_menu\difficulty_select\difficulty_options_small`
- `ui\shell\main_menu\halo_logo`
- `ui\shell\main_menu\settings_select\player_setup\player_profile_edit\color_edit\player_color_marine_large`

These frames are drawn from a frame of the Xbox map's bitmap of the same name, whose other frames differ:
the same picture, or for the profile settings the Xbox's picture for the same thing.

| The PC version's frame | The Xbox's frame |
| --- | --- |
| `shell/main_menu/multiplayer_type_select/mp_options__2.png` | `ui\shell\main_menu\multiplayer_type_select\mp_options` frame 3 |
| `shell/main_menu/settings_select/multiplayer_setup/playlist_edit/gametype_options__2.png` | `ui\shell\main_menu\settings_select\multiplayer_setup\playlist_edit\gametype_options` frame 2 |
| `shell/main_menu/settings_select/multiplayer_setup/playlist_edit/gametype_options__5.png` | `ui\shell\main_menu\settings_select\multiplayer_setup\playlist_edit\gametype_options` frame 4 |
| `shell/main_menu/settings_select/player_setup/player_profile_edit/profile_options__0.png` | `ui\shell\main_menu\settings_select\player_setup\player_profile_edit\profile_options` frame 0 |
| `shell/main_menu/settings_select/player_setup/player_profile_edit/profile_options__2.png` | `ui\shell\main_menu\settings_select\player_setup\player_profile_edit\profile_options` frame 1 |
| `shell/main_menu/settings_select/player_setup/player_profile_edit/profile_options__7.png` | `ui\shell\main_menu\settings_select\player_setup\player_profile_edit\profile_options` frame 3 |

## Illustrations instead of the PC version's pictures

The Xbox's map has none of these (or other pictures under the name), and the PC version's own
(Bungie's art) is not shipped. Each frame is a plain illustration in the menus' blue, one per entry
of the menu list it previews, drawn by `tools/menu_icons.py` (sources in `svg_icons/`):

| File | Previews |
| --- | --- |
| `ce/shell/main_menu/multiplayer_type_select/mp_options__0.png` | the games to join or create |
| `ce/shell/main_menu/multiplayer_type_select/mp_options__1.png` | the server browser |
| `.../playlist_edit/gametype_options__0.png` | Change name |
| `.../playlist_edit/gametype_options__3.png` | Item options |
| `.../playlist_edit/gametype_options__4.png` | Indicator options |
| `.../playlist_edit/gametype_options__6.png` | Vehicle options |
| `.../playlist_edit/gametype_options__7.png` | Teamplay options |
| `.../player_profile_edit/profile_options__1.png` | Controls setup |
| `.../player_profile_edit/profile_options__3.png` | Mouse setup |
| `.../player_profile_edit/profile_options__4.png` | Audio setup |
| `.../player_profile_edit/profile_options__5.png` | Video setup |
| `.../player_profile_edit/profile_options__6.png` | Change colour |
| `.../player_profile_edit/profile_options__8.png` | Network setup |

The PC version's `ui\gamespy` and `ui\ticker` fonts are drawn with `ui\small_ui`, which
the Xbox's map has.
